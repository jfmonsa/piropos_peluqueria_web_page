# Piropos hairdresser website
This repo is about a website that I developed when I was 17 years old at that moment, I was learning PHP and the basics of SQL in order to make dynamic websites, this one was my first project, so it has for sure some bad practices in the code, some bugs, and weird visual design, since that moment I've improved my skills, knowledged and good practices, but I don't applied them in this project cause I want to save it as a memory of my first project.

I developed this project voluntarily (without payment) for a hairdresser located in TuluÃ¡, Colombia (My hometown ðŸ˜€ â™¥).

I finished this project, I presented it to the piropos hairdresser's owner, but she never used it because she prefers old methods for scheduling appointments with clients, like using a notebook to write down appointments, then this website is still online but is no longer used by the hairdresser owner
