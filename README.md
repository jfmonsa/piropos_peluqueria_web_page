# Piropos hairdresser website
This repo is about a website that I coded when I was 17 years old, at that moment I was learning PHP and the basics of SQL in order to mix them with HTML and CSS and make dynamic websites, this one was my first project, so the code has for sure some bad practices, some bugs, and a weird visual design. Since that moment I've coded a lot of and entered to the college so I've improved my skills, knowledge and good practices, but I've not applied them in this project because I want to save it as a memory of my first serious website.

I developed this project voluntarily (without payment) for a hairdresser located in TuluÃ¡, Colombia (My hometown ðŸ˜€ â™¥), the reason for develop this project was for practicing PHP and SQL.

When I finished this project, I presented it to the Piropos hairdresser's owner, but she never used it because she prefers old methods for scheduling appointments with clients, like using a notebook. Then this website is still available online but is no used by the Piropos hairdresser.
